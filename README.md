#### BONUS BADGE!!!

 ## Description:

##### ___get_next_line is a project where we learn about reading file descriptors and more!!!___

- we learn a lot about pointers, and memory allocation/freeing
- we are introduced to a new variable concept, static variable.
- bonus part is about manipulating different fd's at the same time and you only got one static variable to do it.
